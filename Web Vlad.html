<div class=\container\ <h1>Vlad The Impaler</h1>
<p>Vlad the Impaler, also known as Vlad III or Vlad Dracula, was a 15th-century ruler of Wallachia, a region in present-day Romania. He was known for his fierce and brutal tactics against his enemies, particularly the Ottoman Turks. His nickname "the Impaler" comes from his preferred method of execution, in which he would impale his enemies on stakes.</p>
